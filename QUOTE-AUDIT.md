## Principles Checked

1. **No "too" on first sell/hold** - The first drop mention should not end with "too"
2. **Progressive hold language** - Use "too" for consecutive holds ("held...and held through that too")
3. **"But" when finally selling after holds** - "but that one got you" not "and that one got you too"
4. **No double "but"** - "but who can blame you? But..." should use "Nonetheless"
5. **"Nonetheless" only for sellers** - Only use when they sold and came back
6. **"years" for 12+ months only** - Shorter streaks should say "months"
7. **"Fear/panic was real" only for sellers** - Don't mention fear if they never sold
8. **No duplicate phrases** - "The fear was real" should only appear once

## Issues Found

**No issues found!** All quotes pass the audit checks.

## Notes

This audit checks for common issues based on the established quote generation principles. Some flagged issues may be false positives that require manual review.

### Key Rules

1. **First sell in sequence:** "and it got you" (no "too")
2. **Subsequent sells:** "and that one got you too"
3. **Consecutive holds:** "but you held" → "and you held through that too"
4. **Sell after holds:** "but that one got you" (switches from "and" to "but")
5. **Transition after multiple sells:** "Nonetheless, you..."
6. **Transition after single sell/mostly holds:** "Then you went on to..." or "But you..."
