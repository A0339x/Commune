> You bought in while the price was flying — watching your money multiply felt incredible. Then the drops came. April tested us — and it got you. May 2022 hit and 50% was gone overnight — and you sold some too. But October? Somehow you held through that one. The panic was real each time. Nonetheless, you also kept buying, 4 months in a row, while the price kept going down or sideways. Is the project dead? Is it still doing something? Those questions were always there, but you kept building your position nonetheless. That's a different kind of patience. We're glad you're still here. Welcome!

> New wallet or new to GUARD — either way, welcome. If you lived through everything before, you know all we've been up to. If you're just finding us, you joined during a lull, not knowing what came before, but nonetheless, you went heavy fast. But watching the price go sideways or down after you buy? That's rough. A few days or weeks of that and you sold some. Totally normal — we've all been there. But you came back, and chose to grab some more GUARD for the future. We're glad you're here.

If you're just finding us, you joined during a lull, not knowing what came before, but nonetheless, you went heavy fast. The price didn't move the way you hoped, and you sold some — that's a hard feeling, watching your money sit there or go down. But you came back and chose to keep building your position throughout multiple purchases. That takes something. We're glad you're here. Welcome to the community!

> You're a Founding Member. You've been here since before there was a 'here.' You watched GUARD climb — that feeling of watching your investment grow was incredible. And all of you were smart enough to take some profits along the way. Then came the drops: February 2022, April, May's crash, October's despair, the long decline. February 2022 got you, as did April and May and October — but you kept building your position through all of it, buying for 7 months in a row. The community scattered for a while during that time, but we're really glad you're still here. Welcome back.

And you just held. Then May came — 50% crash overnight. Everyone was selling. You didn't. Through the uncertainty, through October's despair, through the long decline. Never sold once. That's what it looks like to buy something you believe in, hold, and focus on other things. The community scattered for a while during that time, but we're really glad you're still here.
