> You bought in while the price was flying — that feeling of watching your money grow was incredible. Then the drops came. April tested us — but you held. May 2022's crash hit — and you held through that too. October dropped — and somehow you held through all of it. On top of that, you kept building your position, while the price kept going down or sideways. Is the project dead? Is it still doing something? Those questions were always there, but you kept at it nonetheless. That's a different kind of patience. We're glad you're still here. Welcome!

> You bought in while the price was flying — that feeling of watching your money grow was incredible. Then the drops came — April, May 2022's crash, October. Everyone around you was panicking, selling. And you just held. Through all of it. Through the crash, through the uncertainty, through the long decline. Never sold once. Four years. That's what it looks like to buy something you believe in, hold, and focus on other things. That's conviction. We're glad you're still here. Welcome!

> You were here before there was a community. Day one. You watched it all — the excitement, the crashes, the quiet months. Then you've seen every crash, every quiet month. The February 2022 scare got most of us to sell — but you held. April tested us again — and you held through that too. May 2022's crash got even more — and somehow you held through that one as well. Nonetheless, you kept coming back and building your position, 3 months in a row, while the price kept going down or sideways. Is the project dead? Is it still doing something?

But you lived through the long decline — month after month of the chart going down or sideways, and you chose to keep building your position anyway. You sold some along the way.

April got most of us again — and that one rattled you too. But May 2022? Somehow you held through that one. The fear was real. Nonetheless, you kept building your position, 4 months in a row, while the price kept going down or sideways. Is the project dead? Is it still doing something? Those questions were always there, but you kept at it nonetheless. That's a different kind of patience. The community scattered for a while during that time, but we're really glad you're still here.

> You've been here since early 2022 — that's a long time in crypto. You watched the price climb, watched it crash, watched the long decline. The February 2022 scare got most of us to sell — but you held. April tested us again — and you held through that too. May 2022's crash got even more — and somehow you held through that one as well. Through the crash, through the uncertainty, through the long decline. Never sold once. Four years. That's what it looks like to buy something you believe in, hold, and focus on other things.
