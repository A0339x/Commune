## Wording Templates

Please fill in the "Suggested Wording" for each pattern. Consider:
- First sell should be stated directly
- Second sell should vary language ("that one got you too", "shook you too")
- Third/fourth sells should escalate ("didn't manage to hold on either", "but who can blame you?")
- Holds should be acknowledged ("but you held", "somehow you held through that one")
